## Description

Blood Red Moon Sprite Animation is an interactive web project that demonstrates CSS sprite animation techniques using a mystical horse and moon theme.  
The project features clickable and animated horse parts (tail, legs, eyes, ears) that respond with smooth sprite animations, all styled with custom fonts and a dramatic, atmospheric background.

The design draws inspiration from folklore and fantasy, and games like IncrediBox aiming to create an engaging musically and visually rich experience for students learning about CSS animations.
